# OverlapTransformer

The code for our paper submitted to IROS 2022:  

**OverlapTransformer: An Efficient and Rotation-Invariant Transformer Network for LiDAR-Based Place Recognition.**  

OverlapTransformer (OT) is a novel lightweight neural network exploiting the range image representation of LiDAR sensors to achieve fast execution with **less than 4 ms per frame**. The arxiv link is coming soon ...

Developed by [Junyi Ma](https://github.com/BIT-MJY), [Xieyuanli Chen](https://github.com/Chen-Xieyuanli) and [Jun Zhang](https://github.com/zhangjun-xyz).

## Dependencies

We are using pytorch-gpu for neural networks.

A nvidia GPU is needed for faster retrival.
OverlapTransformer is also fast enough when using the neural network on CPU.

To use a GPU, first you need to install the nvidia driver and CUDA.

- CUDA Installation guide: [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)

- System dependencies:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update 
  sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-tk
  sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
  ```

- Python dependencies (may also work with different versions than mentioned in the requirements file)

  ```bash
  sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
## How to use
We currently only provide the training and test tutorials for KITTI sequences in this repository. The tutorials for Haomo dataset will be open-source once Haomo dataset is released.  

For a quick test of the training and testing procedures, you could use our [model pretrained on KITTI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FNrx9pcDa9NF7z8CFtuTWyauNkeSEFW4/view?usp=sharing).  

### Data structure

We will recommend you follow our data structure.

```

You should download the following necessary files and put them in the right positions of the structure above:
- [pretrained_overlap_transformer.pth.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FNrx9pcDa9NF7z8CFtuTWyauNkeSEFW4/view?usp=sharing): Our pretrained OT on KITTI sequences for easier evaluation.
- [des_list.npy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13btLQiUokuSHYx229WxtcHGw49-oxmX2/view?usp=sharing): descriptors of Haomo dataset generated by our pretrained OT for visualization.

#### Dataset structure
In the file [config.yaml](https://github.com/haomo-ai/OverlapTransformer/blob/master/config/config.yml), the parameters of `data_root` are described as follows:
```
  data_root_folder (KITTI sequences root) follows:
  ├── 00
  │   ├── depth_map
  │     ├── 000000.png
  │     ├── 000001.png
  │     ├── 000002.png
  │     ├── ...
  │   └── overlaps
  │     ├── train_set.npz
  ├── 01
  ├── 02
  ├── ...
  └── 10
  
  valid_scan_folder (KITTI sequence 02 velodyne) contains:
  ├── 000000.bin
  ├── 000001.bin
  ...

  gt_valid_folder (KITTI sequence 02 computed overlaps) contains:
  ├── 02
  │   ├── overlap_0.npy
  │   ├── overlap_10.npy
  ...
```
You should download or generate the following files and put them in the right positions of the structure above:
- You can find `gt_valid_folder` for sequence 02 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13_1j20Uq3ppjVEkYaYcKjiJ2Zm7tudyH/view?usp=sharing).   
- Since all the KITTI sequences need a large memory, we recommend you generate range images such as `00/depth_map/000000.png` by the preprocessing from [Overlap_Localization](https://github.com/PRBonn/overlap_localization/blob/master/src/prepare_training/gen_depth_and_normal_map.py) or its [C++ version](https://github.com/PRBonn/overlap_localization/tree/master/src/prepare_training/c_utils), and we will not provide these images. Please note that in OverlapTransformer, the `.png` images are used instead of `.npy` files saved in [Overlap_Localization](https://github.com/PRBonn/overlap_localization/blob/master/src/prepare_training/gen_depth_and_normal_map.py).
- More directly, you can generate `.png` range images by [the script from OverlapNet](https://github.com/haomo-ai/OverlapTransformer/blob/master/tools/utils/gen_depth_data.py) updated by us.
- `overlaps` folder of each sequence is provided by the authors of OverlapNet [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i333NUC1DnJglXasqkGYCmo9p45Fx28-/view?usp=sharing).


### Training

In the file [config.yaml](https://github.com/haomo-ai/OverlapTransformer/blob/master/config/config.yml), `training_seqs` are set for the KITTI sequencs used for training.  

You can start the training with

```
cd train
python ./training_overlap_transformer_kitti.py
```
You can resume from our pretrained model [here](https://github.com/haomo-ai/OverlapTransformer/blob/86cd4a53e1be7029de445ec8b2f3d0fbdb8d38c4/train/training_overlap_transformer_kitti.py#L53) for training.


### Testing

Once a model has been trained , the performance of the network can be evaluated. Before testing, the parameters shoud be set in [config.yaml](https://github.com/haomo-ai/OverlapTransformer/blob/master/config/config.yml)

- `test_seqs`: sequence number for evaluation which is "00" in our work.
- `test_weights`: path of the pretrained model.
- `gt_file`: path of the ground truth file provided by the author of OverlapNet, which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1upAwJBF-_UIB7R8evW0PuJBM3RnrTbzl/view?usp=sharing).


Therefore you can start the testing scripts as follows:

```
cd test
python test_kitti00_PR_prepare.py
python test_kitti00_PR.py
```
After you run `test_kitti00_PR_prepare.py`, a file named `predicted_des_L2_dis.npz` is generated in `test_results_kitti`, which is used by `python test_kitti00_PR.py`  

For a quick test of the training and testing procedures, you could use our [pretrained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FNrx9pcDa9NF7z8CFtuTWyauNkeSEFW4/view?usp=sharing).  

### Visualization
We provide a visualization demo for Haomo dataset To be provided (Fig. 1). Please download the [descriptors](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13btLQiUokuSHYx229WxtcHGw49-oxmX2/view?usp=sharing) firstly and then:
```
cd visualize
python viz_haomo.py
```

### C++ implemention (coming soon)

We will provide a C++ implemention of OverlapTransformer with libtorch for faster retrival.
