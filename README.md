# OverlapTransformer

The code for our paper submitted to IROS 2022:  

**OverlapTransformer: An Efficient and Rotation-Invariant Transformer Network for LiDAR-Based Place Recognition.  
**
OverlapTransformer is a novel lightweight neural network exploiting the range image representation of LiDAR sensors to achieve fast execution with less than 4 ms per frame.

This is an animation for finding the top1 candidate with **OverlapTransformer** on sequence 1-1 (database) and 1-3 (query) of **Haomo dataset**.  
**Haomo dataset** which is collected by **HAOMO.AI** will be released soon.
